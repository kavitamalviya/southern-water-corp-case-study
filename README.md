            **Southern Water Corp Python Case Study**

In this case study, you will be dealing with minute by minute time-series data. The data
will be recorded every minute for a number of variables like temperature. In particular,
you will use each of the descriptive techniques you learned and reinforce this with
analyzing the behavior of a desalination plant pump before failure and during failure.

For your statistical analysis, youâ€™ll be measuring your analytical
success by ensuring you can clearly tell the Executives at Southern Water Corp a
meaningful story. This story should unpack which variables need to be monitored closely
with respect to pump failure, as well as creation of a multivariate linear equation that will
become the statistical alarm the engineers can use to automatically pick up failure.
